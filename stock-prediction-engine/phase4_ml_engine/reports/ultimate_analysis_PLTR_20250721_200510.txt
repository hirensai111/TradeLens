🧠 AI REASONING:
  Extreme volatility (57.7%) significantly impacts confidence, reducing it to 30.6%. While fresh search shows positive sentiment (+2.171), the weak signal (-0.081) and high volatility suggest mostly sideways movement with wide trading ranges. Monte Carlo paths indicate slight upward bias (52.8% probability) but with substantial price variation potential.
